This is a simple date and time manipulator. Using this package you can get some helpful features like finding difference between dates, and getting current date and time by passing a string. More features are being developed by our team.

## üì¶ Installation

### Install this package via npm:

```bash
npm install @aimu/date-manipulator
```

This package is also available on unpkg, so you can load it via script tag:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@aimu/date-manipulator"></script>
<script>
    // You can use library features here.
</script>
```

## üî® Usage

### Input

You can pass any valid arguments of Date() built-in javascript object.

You can also pass options as object, right now, there's only one option available: *hFormat: 12 or 24 as string value (It's 24 by default)*.

*Example:*

```js
var d = new dateM({
    hFormat: '12'
});
console.log(d.current("dd-mm-yyyy hh:mm")); // Prints current date and time format in 12 hours.
```

### Methods

#### dateM().current()

This method returns a string replaced by a requested values.

```js
var d = dateM();

// dd - date, mm - month, yyyy - year.
// Don't use spaces between time values requesting string.
// hh:mm:ss - OK
// hh mm ss - Warning: You may don't get what you expect.

// Example:
d.current("dd-mm-yyyy hh:mm:ss") // Prints current date and time.
```

#### dateM.timePassed()

Using this method you can get difference between two dates in days.

_Note: Arguments should be dateM objects._

*Example:*

```js
var b = new dateM(2020, 0, 1);
var e = new dateM(2021, 0, 1);

console.log(dateM.timePassed(b, e)); // Prints 366 
```
